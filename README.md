Odin Project Landing Page Project

Aim of this project was to replicate the image of the web design as closely as possible. Though no design file was given, I estimated margins, padding, text size etc from eye. This showed me how valuable tools like Figma can be for replicating a UI and the value of providing these measurements at the design phase for front end development.
